## Motive
Why spend hours managing reminders when you can automate them with a simple text message?
HydraBot eliminates the need for complicated apps. Just text commands like "remind me to drink water every 2 hours" and reply "done" when complete. Built this way so you don't need to f**k around with app installations and accounts.

## Architecture

```
hydrabot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # FastAPI webhooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py            # Database schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reminder_service.py  # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ messaging_service.py # SMS/Telegram
